# DumbCoin

Welcome to DumbCoin, the world's dumbest cryptocurrency (next to Tron).

DumbCoin was built from scratch in Python as a personal project.

In DumbCoin, the miner of the first block receives the entire money supply - which, as of this writing, is 21 Million DumbCoins.

There is only one type of node in the DumbCoin network and they are all capable of only two things: sending/receiving DumbCoin and mining blocks.

In DumbCoin, Nodes mine their own block upon creating a transaction.

New blocks are broadcasted via a gossip protocol to random neighbors.

This repo also includes the beautiful, and highly-insecure DumbCoin Wallet and Block Explorer.

Enjoy.
